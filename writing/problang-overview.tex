\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	Recent advances in computational cognitive science (i.e., simulation-based probabilistic programs) have paved the way for significant progress in formal, implementable models of pragmatics. Rather than describing a pragmatic reasoning process, these models articulate and implement one, deriving both qualitative and quantitative predictions of human behavior---predictions that consistently prove correct, demonstrating the viability and value of the framework. The current paper provides a practical introduction to the Bayesian Rational Speech Act modeling framework, serving as a companion piece to the hands-on web-book at \href{https://www.problang.org}{www.problang.org}. After providing a conceptual overview of the framework, we then walk readers through the resources of the web-book.

\section{Conceptual overview of the RSA framework}

The RSA framework views language understanding as a process of recursive social reasoning between speakers and listeners: listeners interpret the utterances they hear by reasoning about how speakers generate them; speakers choose their utterances by reasoning about how listeners interpret them. In the basic, vanilla RSA model, this recursion involves three layers of inference. Typically formulated as statements of conditional probability, these inference layers correspond to models of speakers and listeners; they are typically given as conditional probability statements, as in XXX. 

The reasoning grounds out in the naive, literal listener, $L_0$, who interprets utterances according to their literal semantics. In other words, $L_0$ hears some utterance $u$ and infers the state of the world $s$ that $u$ was meant to describe. $L_0$ performs this inference by restricting the set of possible states to just those that are compatible with the literal, truth-functional semantics of $u$, returning a uniform probability distribution over the states $s$ that $u$ maps to \texttt{true}.

One layer up, a pragmatic speaker, $S_1$, chooses utterances in accordance with their utility. Utterances are useful to the extent that they maximize the probability that $L_0$ will infer the intended $s$ on the basis of $u$, all while minimizing the cost of $u$ (speakers are lazy).
